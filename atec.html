Hi! I have lots to say to you but I just can’t put it into words. For years, you’ve been my older sister, my
bestfriend, and my kpop partner. In our family, you were the only one who understands me the most
and I thank you for that. Thank you for being the second mother figure in my life. Thank you for being
the matured person that our family needs in order to balance our differences. Thank you for being
neutral in every situation and for being the wisest in the house. You were one of my inspirations
because you’re able to find happiness from little things. Unlike us, who always want to in the spotlight,
you were the only one content in being in the shadows. I hope I can also find contentment in my life just
like you do. I hope I can mature as you. With that, I wish you that you’ll never be blue again. I wish you a
very Happy Christmas. I hope all your problems will be washed as this special holiday approaches and as
this year ends. I love you sis and may God bless you more.
